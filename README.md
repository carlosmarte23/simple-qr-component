## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got more used to translate a design from figma to actual code, specially the styles using plain CSS. Even if probably it wasnt needed, I started practicing setting custom variables in CSS.

### Continued development

Id like to keep practicing more flexbox and maybe translating this to the grid layout, I tried to do it but still not fell confortable using it and didnt get the result that I wanted.
